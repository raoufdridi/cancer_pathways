Determination of cancer pathways using persistent homology and quantum computing (DWave).

# Description 
It has been recognized that a key step towards defeating cancer is a deep understanding of the genomic  changes that occur before and during the tumorgenesis.  Our work attempts to contribute to this understanding through the proposal of a novel topological framework and to introduce the use of quantum annealing to help with large scale computations one faces 
in genomic data analysis.  We hope that, within this framework and armed with the computational capabilities of quantum computers, a new type of questions about the data can be asked i.e., a different kind of hypotheses can be formulated. We have
used in our analysis real (TCGA) mutation data of two types of tumour:  Acute myeloid leukemia and Glioblastoma multiform.   As a first application, we  explain how the noisy data problem in the data-driven pathways discovery is dealt with within this framework using  persistent homology. We present a complete persistent homology-based algorithm built on the top of our quantum procedure.  For both datasets, using our  homology based  quantum pipeline, we have recovered the same pathways previously found in addition to new additional pathways.
